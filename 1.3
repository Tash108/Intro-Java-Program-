In Java, System.out.print and System.out.println are both methods provided by the System.out object to output text to the console. Here's a simple distinction between the two:

System.out.print:

The System.out.print method is used to print text or values to the console without inserting a new line character at the end.
It outputs the provided text or value as-is, without any additional formatting.
If you use multiple System.out.print statements consecutively, the output will be concatenated without any line breaks.
Here's an example:
java
Copy code
System.out.print("Hello, ");
System.out.print("world!");
Output:

Copy code
Hello, world!
System.out.println:

The System.out.println method is used to print text or values to the console with an appended new line character at the end.
It outputs the provided text or value and adds a line break after it.
If you use multiple System.out.println statements consecutively, each statement will be printed on a new line.
Here's an example:
java
Copy code
System.out.println("Hello");
System.out.println("world!");
Output:

Copy code
Hello
world!
The main distinction is that System.out.print prints the text or value without a line break, while System.out.println prints the text or value with a line break appended. The choice between them depends on whether you want the output to be on the same line or separate lines.
